I"?<p>Cross your heart and say you’ve never given up<br />
That you carried on when every door was shut<br />
That you live, you live with no regret!<br />
We wear a smile to hide that we’ve been hurt before<br />
Keep our disasters in a suitcase by the door,<br />
‘Cause you know, you know we’re only human!</p>
