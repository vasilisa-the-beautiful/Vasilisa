I"ó<p>Talk<br />
Letâ€™s have conversations in the dark<br />
World asleep and Iâ€™m awake with you<br />
With you<br />
Watch<br />
Movies that weâ€™ve both already seen<br />
I ainâ€™t even looking at the screen, itâ€™s true<br />
I got my eyes on you</p>

<p>And you say that youâ€™re not worthy<br />
You get hung up on your flaws<br />
But in my eyes, you are perfect<br />
As you are</p>

<p>I wonâ€™t ever try to change you, change you<br />
I will always want the same you, same you<br />
Swear on everything I pray to<br />
That I wonâ€™t break your heart<br />
Iâ€™ll be there when you get lonely, lonely<br />
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me<br />
And your love is all you owe me<br />
And I wonâ€™t break your heart</p>

<p>On<br />
Sunday mornings we sleep in till noon<br />
Well, I can sleep forever next to you<br />
Next to you<br />
And we<br />
We got places we both gotta be<br />
But there ainâ€™t nothing I would rather do<br />
Than blow off all my plans for you</p>

<p>And you say that youâ€™re not worthy<br />
And get hung up on your flaws<br />
But, in my eyes, you are perfect<br />
As you are<br />
As you are</p>

<p>I wonâ€™t ever try to change you, change you<br />
I will always want the same you, same you<br />
Swear on everything I pray to<br />
That I wonâ€™t break your heart<br />
Iâ€™ll be there when you get lonely, lonely<br />
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me<br />
And your love is all you owe me<br />
And I wonâ€™t break your heart</p>

<p>When no one seems to notice<br />
And your days, they seem so hard<br />
My darling, you should know this<br />
My love is everywhere you are</p>

<p>I wonâ€™t ever try to change you, change you<br />
I will always want the same you, same you<br />
Swear on everything I pray to<br />
That I wonâ€™t break your heart<br />
Iâ€™ll be there when you get lonely, lonely<br />
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me<br />
And your love is all you owe me<br />
And I wonâ€™t break your heart</p>

<p>I wonâ€™t break your heart</p>
