I"t<p>Cross your heart and say you’ve never given up<br />
That you carried on when every door was shut<br />
That you live, you live with no regret!<br />
We wear a smile to hide that we’ve been hurt before<br />
Keep our disasters in a suitcase by the door,<br />
‘Cause you know, you know we’re only human!</p>

<p>So lay your hands on the left behind<br />
We all know how it feels to be forgotten for a while.<br />
In a crowded place trying not to feel alone,<br />
Just remember that we’ve all been broken once!<br />
Let’s love the broken ones, yeah, yeah!<br />
Love the broken ones!</p>

<p>Raise your glass to all the words we never say<br />
We do our best, but still we look the other way,<br />
‘Cause sometimes it’s easier to run<br />
‘Cause after all, we’re only human!</p>

<p>So lay your hands on the left behind<br />
We all know how it feels to be forgotten for a while.<br />
In a crowded place trying not to feel alone,<br />
Just remember that we’ve all been broken once!<br />
Let’s love the broken ones, yeah, yeah!<br />
Love the broken ones!</p>

<p>Sometimes we’re left behind,<br />
Feel like the only one,<br />
But we were born to try<br />
Yeah, we’re only human!</p>

<p>So lay your hand on the left behind<br />
Yeah, we all know how it feels to be forgotten for a while<br />
In a crowded place trying not to feel so alone,<br />
Just remember that we’ve all been broken once!<br />
So let’s love the broken ones, whoa-oh<br />
Love the broken ones, no no<br />
Let’s love the broken ones, whoa oh whoa oh<br />
Love the broken ones, yeah-yeah.<br />
Let’s love the broken ones!</p>
