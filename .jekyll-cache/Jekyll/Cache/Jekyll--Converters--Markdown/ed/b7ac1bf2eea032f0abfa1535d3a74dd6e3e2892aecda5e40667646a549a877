I"G<p>How long will I love you?<br />
As long as stars are above you<br />
And longer, if I can.</p>

<p>How long will I need you?<br />
As long as the seasons need to<br />
Follow their plan.</p>

<p>How long will I be with you?<br />
As long as the sea is bound to<br />
Wash upon the sand.</p>

<p>How long will I want you?<br />
As long as you want me to<br />
And longer by far.</p>

<p>How long will I hold you?<br />
As long as your father told you,<br />
As long as you can.</p>

<p>How long will I give to you?<br />
As long as I live through you<br />
However long you say.</p>

<p>How long will I love you?<br />
As long as stars are above you<br />
And longer, if I may.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re all traveling through time together<br />
Every day of our lives.<br />
All we can do is do our best<br />
To relish this remarkable ride.</p>
