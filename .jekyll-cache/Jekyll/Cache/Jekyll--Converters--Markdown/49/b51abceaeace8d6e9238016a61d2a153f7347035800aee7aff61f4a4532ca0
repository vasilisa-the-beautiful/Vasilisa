I"Ì<p><em>It's strange what desire will make foolish people do*<br />
I never dreamed that I'd meet somebody like you<br />
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you<br />
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)<br />
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)<br />
With you<br />
With you<br />
(This world is only gonna break your heart)<br />
What a wicked game you play, to make me feel this way<br />
What a wicked thing to do, to let me dream of you<br />
What a wicked thing to say, you never felt this way<br />
What a wicked thing to do, to make me dream of you<br />
And I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)<br />
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)<br />
With you<br />
The world was on fire and no one could save me but you<br />
It's strange what desire will make foolish people do<br />
I never dreamed that I'd love somebody like you<br />
And I never dreamed that I'd lose somebody like you<br />
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)<br />
No, I don't wanna fall in love (this world is only gonna break your heart)<br />
With you (this world is only gonna break your heart)
With you<br />
(This world is only gonna break your heart)<br />
No, I (this world is only gonna break your heart)<br />
(This world is only gonna break your heart)<br />
Nobody loves no one<br />
